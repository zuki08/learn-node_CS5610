- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.

So setTimeout is queued up in the timer section. then we have a file I/O that is working. So poll takes precedence and the corresponding callback will be queued and executed. And the pending callback from timers is executed.

- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?

It could, because depending on the order of pending callbacks, the order of the callback execution may differ. So if the timeout happens before I/O finishes and queues, the timeout runs first, followed by the I/O callback.

- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

It could, because depending on the order of pending callbacks, the order of the callback execution may differ. So if the timeout happens before I/O finishes and queues, the timeout runs first, followed by the I/O callback.
